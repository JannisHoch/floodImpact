# How model selection can determine flood risk estimates â€“ a case study in the Ganges basin using the GLOFRIM framework 

This set of code is intended to be used as showcase material for the online EGU2020 conference.It belongs to the online EGU2020 display EGU2020-11086 by Jannis M. Hoch, Dirk Eilander, and Hiroaki Ikeushi.

## Purpose

The background of the project is to investigate how different flood extents, as simulted by different models, translates into varying numbers of people affected during a flood event.

## Content

The code goes step-by-step through the process of 

1. assessing accuracy of simulated flood extent;
1. calculating the differing impact on the number of people affected.

## Execution

The main code is in the ipynb-notebook which upon execution is converted to a html-file.

# note
when running the ipynb-notebook via the sh-file, the converted html-file does not render any citations and references.
this is because the cite2c extension used does not support export yet.
to get the full experience, it may be necessary to open the notebook from command line (not tested yet).
